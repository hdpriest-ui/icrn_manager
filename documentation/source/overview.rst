The Illinois Computes Library & Kernel Manager is designed to simplify the management of R library environments for users of the Illinois Computes Research Notebook (ICRN). Many scientific domains require complex R and Python packages, which can be difficult to install and configure, especially for new users of high-performance computing systems.

This tool provides a user-friendly command-line interface to:

- List available R library environments from a central repository
- Download and activate specific library environments
- Switch between different package sets with a single command
- Avoid manual installation and configuration of R packages

The Illinois Computes Library & Kernel Manager is intended for use on the ICRN platform, but its approach may be useful for other shared research computing environments.
